Reliability Engineering
Overview
Implement a program to check the health of a set of HTTP endpoints. A basic overview is given
in this section. Additional details are provided in the Prompt section.
Read an input argument to a file path with a list of HTTP endpoints in YAML format. Test the
health of the endpoints every 15 seconds. Keep track of the availability percentage of the HTTP
domain names being monitored by the program. Log the cumulative availability percentage for
each domain to the console after the completion of each 15-second test cycle.
Prompt
Sample input file
- headers:
user-agent: fetch-synthetic-monitor
method: GET
name: fetch.com index page
url: https://fetch.com/
- headers:
user-agent: fetch-synthetic-monitor
method: GET
name: fetch.com careers page
url: https://fetch.com/careers
- body: '{"foo":"bar"}'
headers:
content-type: application/json
user-agent: fetch-synthetic-monitor
method: POST
name: fetch.com some post endpoint
url: https://fetch.com/some/post/endpoint
- name: www.fetchrewards.com index page
url: https://www.fetchrewards.com/
Parsing the program input
The program must accept a single, required input argument to a configuration file path. A
well-formed configuration file is a YAML list. Each entry in the YAML list follows a consistent
schema, and contains enough information for the program to send a well-formed HTTP request.
You may assume that the contents of a configuration file given to your program are valid (you do
not need to validate the schema of the configuration file).
An example of a valid YAML configuration file is included in the Sample input file section. While
you may use this particular file for testing and validation purposes, your program must accept an
arbitrary file path as its input.
Each HTTP endpoint element in the YAML list has the following schema:
● name (string, required) — A free-text name to describe the HTTP endpoint.
● url (string, required) — The URL of the HTTP endpoint.
○ You may assume that the URL is always a valid HTTP or HTTPS address.
● method (string, optional) — The HTTP method of the endpoint.
○ If this field is present, you may assume it’s a valid HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST,
etc.).
○ If this field is omitted, the default is GET.
● headers (dictionary, optional) — The HTTP headers to include in the request.
○ If this field is present, you may assume that the keys and values of this dictionary
are strings that are valid HTTP header names and values.
○ If this field is omitted, no headers need to be added to or modified in the HTTP
request.
● body (string, optional) — The HTTP body to include in the request.
○ If this field is present, you should assume it's a valid JSON-encoded string. You
do not need to account for non-JSON request bodies.
○ If this field is omitted, no body is sent in the request.
Running the health checks
After parsing the YAML input configuration file, the program should send an HTTP request to
each endpoint every 15 seconds. Each time an HTTP request is executed by the program,
determine if the outcome is UP or DOWN:
● UP — The HTTP response code is 2xx (any 200–299 response code) and the response
latency is less than 500 ms.
● DOWN — The endpoint is not UP.
Keep testing the endpoints every 15 seconds until the user manually exits the program.
Logging the results
Each time the program finishes testing all the endpoints in the configuration file, log the
availability percentage of each URL domain over the lifetime of the program to the console.
Availability percentage is defined as:
100 * (number of HTTP requests that had an outcome of UP / number of
HTTP requests)
The example YAML file in the Sample input file section contains two URL domains: fetch.com
and www.fetchrewards.com. Note that the number of domains present in a configuration file
can differ from the number of endpoints present in the file (two domains vs. four endpoints in
this particular file).
Here’s the complete expected output to the console of a sample execution of the program:
fetch.com has 33% availability percentage
www.fetchrewards.com has 100% availability percentage
fetch.com has 67% availability percentage
www.fetchrewards.com has 50% availability percentage
Here is the internal program state that led to the above output:
Program execution begins at time = 0 seconds. Program reads and parses the sample
configuration file given as its input argument.
Test cycle #1 begins at time = 0 seconds:
● Endpoint with name fetch.com index page has HTTP response code 200 and
response latency 100 ms => UP
● Endpoint with name fetch.com careers page has HTTP response code 200 and
response latency 600 ms => DOWN (response latency is not less than 500 ms)
● Endpoint with name fetch.com some post endpoint has HTTP response code
500 and response latency 50 ms => DOWN (response code is not in range 200–299)
● Endpoint with name www.fetchrewards.com index page has HTTP response code
200 and response latency 100 ms => UP
Test cycle #1 ends. The program logs to the console:
fetch.com has 33% availability percentage
www.fetchrewards.com has 100% availability percentage
This is the expected output because 1/3 of fetch.com health checks are UP and 1/1
www.fetchrewards.com health checks are UP.
Test cycle #2 begins at time = 15 seconds:
● Endpoint with name fetch.com index page has HTTP response code 200 and
response latency 100 ms => UP
● Endpoint with name fetch.com careers page has HTTP response code 200 and
response latency 300 ms => UP
● Endpoint with name fetch.com some post endpoint has HTTP response code
201 and response latency 50 ms => UP
● Endpoint with name www.fetchrewards.com index page has HTTP response code
200 and response latency 900 ms => DOWN (response latency is not less than 500 ms)
Test cycle #2 ends. The program logs to the console:
fetch.com has 67% availability percentage
www.fetchrewards.com has 50% availability percentage
This is the expected output because 4/6 of fetch.com health checks are UP and 1/2
www.fetchrewards.com health checks are UP since the program began running.
User presses CTRL+C and the program exits.
Note that when logging the availability percentage for each domain, the program should round
floating-point availability percentages to the nearest whole percentage.
FAQ
How will my solution be graded?
An engineer will review the code you submit. At a minimum, they must be able to run the code
and it must produce the expected results. While your solution does not need to be fully
production-ready, you are being evaluated, so put your best foot forward.
What programming language should I use?
You may use any language. Choose something that allows you to showcase what you know.
Can I use third-party open source software?
Yes, you may use publicly available third-party open source software to assist with your solution.
If you include third-party components, you should ensure that your solution’s instructions allow
the exercise reviewer to successfully build and run your code.
How do I submit my solution?
We strongly recommend uploading your solution to a publicly accessible git-based repository
system (e.g. Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket). This will allow the fastest and easiest way for the
reviewer to assess your solution.
Do I need to provide instructions to the reviewer in my repository?
You should assume that the reviewer has no familiarity with your programming language of
choice. You should therefore provide instructions in a README or similar format on how to build
and run your solution. Keep in mind that the exercise reviewer may have a different operating
system or software installed on their local machine, so make minimal assumptions in your
instructions.
Should I use a durable data store (e.g. disk, SQL/NoSQL databases) for keeping track
of availability percentages?
Definitely not. For the purposes of this exercise, it is fine to use a suitable data structure in your
application’s memory to keep track of and log the expected program output over time as each
testing cycle completes. We do not expect your solution to persist data durably across multiple
executions of your program.
How long do I have to complete the exercise?
There is no time limit for the exercise. We have designed the exercise so that it should take a
few hours. But please take as much time as you need to put your best solution forward.
I have a question about the problem statement.
Use your best judgment to design and implement a program that meets the requirements of the
prompt. Anything not explicitly stated is left to your discretion.
